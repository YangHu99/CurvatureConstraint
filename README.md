# Constrain Curvature with Strong Lenses and Complementary Probes
This repository contains all the data and code for the project "Constraining Curvature Density Parameter by Combining Time-Delay Lenses with Other Probes: a Forecast for Next-Generation Surveys". 

Users will need to install [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/install/), [corner](https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/) and [george](https://george.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/) python packages in order to run the code in the [script](/script) directory.

In the [script](/script) directory, users can find code for analysis on constraining curvature density parameter and other cosmological parameters using strong gravitational lenses with other complimentary probes. The analysis are done in either a parametric or a non-parametric method.

In the [data](/data) directory, users can find simulated data files used in this project.    

As the data used are mostly simulations for next-generation cosmological surveys, this analysis provides a forcast on the ability of using next-generation strong gravitational lenses data to constrain curvature density parameter. This is a promising way to obtain a high-fidelity constraint on curvature density parameter that is indepedent from early-universe probe CMB.
