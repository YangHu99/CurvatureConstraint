This directory provides code for analysis to constrain curvature density parameter.

**"parametric"** indicates that a parametric cosmological model (e.g. owCDM) is used the analysis.  
**"non-parametric"** indicates that a parametric cosmological model is not used the analysis.
**"HzGP"** means that the Hubble parameter H(z) values are obtained by Gaussian Process regression from just a few sample points rather than any assumed analytical cosmological models.       
**"plotting"** indicates scripts specifically for plotting relevant figures.
