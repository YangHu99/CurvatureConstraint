This directory provides code for analysis to constrain curvature density parameter.

**"Lenses"** indicates that strong gravitational lenses are involved in the analysis.  
**"SNe"** indicates that Type Ia supernovae are involved in the analysis.   
**"BAO"** indicates that baryon accoustic oscillations are involved in the analysis.   
**"HzGP"** indicates that the analysis is non-parametric, i.e. Hz values are obtained by Gaussian Process interpolation rather than any assumed cosmological models.
